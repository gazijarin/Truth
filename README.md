A remake of the solar system created using Three.js. 
<p align="center">
In this simple simulation, the solar system was re-designed using Three.js as an interface to WEBGL. The user is able to interact with the focal object, the monolith, and its surroundings by controlling the cursor. Each of the planets, albeit not to scale or to actual orbital radius, are more or less represented accurately in relative to each other - each having their own texture maps, rings (if necessary) and their unique rotation. The monolith, instead of the Sun, was used as the central object to symbolize the brink of human knowledge and evolution (an inspiration drawn from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey). They are all positioned in a skybox, called the Dispair Ridge, to provide an illusion of space. 

Check out the complete [three.js](https://threejs.org/) documentation for more information.
